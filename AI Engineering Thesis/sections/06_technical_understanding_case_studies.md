# 6. Technical Understanding: Case Studies

To demonstrate the practical application of AI-First engineering principles, this section presents detailed case studies of two common AI system implementations: a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system and an autonomous agent-based system.

## RAG Implementation Deep Dive

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines information retrieval with generative AI to produce outputs that are both relevant and grounded in specific knowledge sources. This case study examines the development of a RAG system for a technical documentation assistant.

### Architecture and Components

The RAG system consists of five primary components:

1. **Document Processing Pipeline**
   ```python
   def process_documents(documents):
       # Chunk documents into manageable segments
       chunks = chunker.split_documents(documents, chunk_size=1000, overlap=200)
       
       # Extract metadata from each chunk
       for chunk in chunks:
           chunk.metadata = extract_metadata(chunk.text)
       
       # Generate embeddings for each chunk
       embeddings = embedding_model.encode_batch([chunk.text for chunk in chunks])
       
       # Store chunks and embeddings in vector database
       vector_db.add_documents(chunks, embeddings)
       
       return len(chunks)
   ```

2. **Vector Database**
   - Stores document chunks and their vector representations
   - Supports efficient similarity search
   - Includes metadata filtering capabilities
   - Implemented using a specialized vector database (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate, or FAISS)

3. **Query Processing System**
   ```python
   def process_query(query_text, filters=None):
       # Generate embedding for the query
       query_embedding = embedding_model.encode(query_text)
       
       # Retrieve relevant documents based on semantic similarity
       relevant_chunks = vector_db.similarity_search(
           query_embedding, 
           k=5,  # Number of results to retrieve
           filters=filters  # Optional metadata filters
       )
       
       # Format retrieved context for the LLM
       context = format_context(relevant_chunks)
       
       return context
   ```

4. **Generation Component**
   ```python
   def generate_response(query, context):
       # Construct prompt with retrieved context
       prompt = f"""
       You are a technical documentation assistant. Answer the question based on the provided context.
       If you cannot find the answer in the context, say so.
       
       Context:
       {context}
       
       Question: {query}
       
       Answer:
       """
       
       # Generate response using LLM
       response = llm.generate(prompt, 
                              temperature=0.3,
                              max_tokens=500)
       
       return response
   ```

5. **Feedback Collection and Improvement System**
   ```python
   def collect_feedback(query, response, user_rating):
       # Store interaction for later analysis
       feedback_store.add_entry({
           "query": query,
           "response": response,
           "rating": user_rating,
           "timestamp": datetime.now()
       })
       
       # If negative feedback, flag for human review
       if user_rating < 3:
           review_queue.add_item(query, response, user_rating)
       
       return True
   ```

### Development Process

           }
           self.episodic_memory.add(episode)

           self.semantic_memory.add_facts(facts)
           
       def retrieve_relevant(self, task):
           # Get semantically similar past experiences
           similar_episodes = self.episodic_memory.find_similar(task)
           
           # Get relevant factual knowledge
           relevant_facts = self.semantic_memory.query(task)
           
           return {

           self.llm = llm  # Large Language Model for planning
           self.available_tools = tools  # Available actions
           
       def create_plan(self, task, context):
           # Generate plan using LLM
