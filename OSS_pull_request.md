**What**: Add support for custom contribution types in the All Contributors specification

This PR adds support for custom contribution types, allowing projects to define their own contribution categories with associated emojis in their `.all-contributorsrc` file.

**Why**: 
- Projects often have unique ways of contributing that don't fit into the standard categories
- Custom contribution types allow projects to better recognize and categorize these unique contributions
- Provides more flexibility while maintaining the structured approach of the All Contributors specification

**How**:
1. Added `customContributions` configuration field in `.all-contributorsrc`:
   ```
   {
     "customContributions": {
       "mentoring": "üë®‚Äçüè´",
       "funding": "üíµ",
       "translation": "üåç"
     }
   }
   ```
2. Updated core specification documentation to include custom types
3. Enhanced bot and CLI documentation with examples and usage instructions
4. Added notes about current CLI limitations
